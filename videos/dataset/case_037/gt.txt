The 3D model now features an alien creature with the original design of alien.obj, enhanced by the intricate skin texture from alien_skin.png. The alien maintains its stylized humanoid form, with an elongated, slender body and a large, smooth, rounded head devoid of distinct facial features, creating an otherworldly aesthetic. The torso is narrow and elongated, while the arms and legs are long and thin, giving the model a tall, lanky appearance. The alien's posture remains slightly hunched, with its head leaning forward and arms hanging down.

The skin texture from alien_skin.png adds a fantastical and vibrant layer to the model, covering it in a greenish-blue hue with intricate, swirling patterns. This texture enhances the alien's smooth, grayish form, adding an organic and futuristic feel. The large, glowing eyes and sharp, pointed teeth from the image are incorporated into the model, along with small, spiky protrusions along the back, resulting in a menacing and formidable appearance.

The OBJ file, alien.obj, represents the alien's stylized humanoid structure, while the PNG file, alien_skin.png, provides the vibrant and intricate skin texture that brings the creature to life.
