The 3D model now features a sports car with a dragon-themed tail attached, creating a unique and playful hybrid design. The car retains its sleek, modern appearance with a low profile, aerodynamic lines, and an aggressive front end, complete with a distinct grille and sleek headlights. The dragon's tail, taken from the stylized dragon image, is seamlessly integrated at the rear of the car. It features smooth, teal-colored scales and prominent golden spikes, adding a whimsical and fantasy-inspired element to the car's design. The tail's elegant curl enhances the vehicle's dynamic look, while the car's sporty curves and large wheels emphasize its high-performance nature. The transformation results in an imaginative blend of automotive engineering and mythical creature aesthetics.
