The 3D model now features a mirror with a Charmander-themed design, incorporating the iconic flame tail. The original cylindrical form of the mirror is retained, with its smooth, oval shape and light, possibly translucent, surface on the front and back. The cylindrical structure remains consistent in thickness, with darker side surfaces that contrast with the lighter front and back. The top and bottom views reveal a circular form with reflective qualities, enhancing the mirror's appearance. The addition of Charmander's flame tail integrates a vibrant, fiery element to the design, adding a playful and thematic touch to the mirror. This transformation results in a unique and visually appealing hybrid, combining the practicality of a mirror with the distinctive Charmander motif. The OBJ file, mirror.obj, represents the original cylindrical model, showcasing its smooth surfaces and contrasting finishes.
