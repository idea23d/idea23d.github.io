The 3D model now showcases a dual-purpose object, combining the features of both a water bottle and a cup. The main body retains the cylindrical shape and translucent bluish tint of the water bottle, with a rounded bottom for stability and a standard neck. However, the top of the bottle has been adapted to include the wide circular opening of the cup, allowing it to function as a mug as well. The handle of the cup is seamlessly integrated into the side of the bottle, offering an ergonomic grip. The model merges the practical design of the water bottle with the sleek, glossy finish of the cup, resulting in a versatile and modern hybrid.

The OBJ files, water_bottle.obj and cup.obj, represent these respective models. The water_bottle model features a functional design with a translucent body and practical shape, while the cup model displays a smooth, glossy surface with a distinct handle and wide base.
