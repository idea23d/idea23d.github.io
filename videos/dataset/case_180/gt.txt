The 3D model now features a sports car with a lion's head grille, seamlessly integrating the majestic and detailed lion's head from the image into the car's design. The car maintains its sleek, aerodynamic profile with a low, wide stance and smooth curves. The lion's head, with its flowing mane in rich shades of brown and gold, is positioned at the front, replacing the original grille. The lion's realistic features, including sharp eyes and a regal expression, add a powerful and unique element to the car's design, enhancing its futuristic and bold appearance. The integration creates a striking and imaginative hybrid of a sports car with the noble visage of a lion.

The OBJ file, car.obj, represents the aerodynamic sports car model, characterized by its futuristic design and streamlined features, while the IMG file, lion.png, provides an artistic illustration of a lion's head with detailed and vibrant characteristics.
