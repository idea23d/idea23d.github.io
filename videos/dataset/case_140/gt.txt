The 3D model now features a computer with an integrated mouse design. The classic desktop setup maintains its original components: a CRT monitor with a thick bezel and angled screen, a tower-style CPU with a smooth surface and front panel features, and a full-sized keyboard with a traditional layout. The integration involves creatively attaching the mouse model to the computer setup, possibly as a built-in input device on the side or top of the keyboard. The mouse retains its ergonomic design, with a slightly curved body and central scroll wheel, smoothly merging with the computer's aesthetic. The color scheme is harmonized, combining the neutral tones of the computer with the modern, professional look of the mouse. This results in a unique and functional hybrid model, capturing the essence of early 2000s computer hardware with a contemporary twist.
The OBJ files, computer.obj and mouse.obj, represent these respective models. The computer model showcases a classic desktop setup with detailed components, while the mouse model emphasizes ergonomic design and modern aesthetics.
