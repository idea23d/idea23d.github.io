The image now features a red apple with a mushroom growing on its stalk. The apple retains its realistic appearance with a smooth, glossy surface and rich red hue. The perfectly rounded shape and small brown stem remain intact, but a mushroom has now sprouted from the stem. The mushroom adds an interesting and unexpected element to the picture, contrasting with the apple's polished look. The background stays softly blurred, ensuring the focus remains on the transformed apple. The lighting continues to create gentle shadows, enhancing the three-dimensional effect.
