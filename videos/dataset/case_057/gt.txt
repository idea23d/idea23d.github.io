The 3D model now features a hedgehog with quills that resemble pencils, maintaining the original compact and rounded form. The hedgehog's body retains its realistic texture, with a domed back and pointed snout. The face, with small round eyes and a protruding snout, remains smooth and contrasts with the back. However, the quills have been replaced with pencil-like structures. These pencil quills maintain the radial arrangement, with tips pointing outward, resembling the colored pencils depicted in the image. The vibrant colors and wooden texture of the pencils add a unique visual element, while the hedgehog's short legs are slightly visible from the sides, preserving its characteristic appearance. The transformation results in a creative and whimsical hybrid of a hedgehog with pencil quills. The OBJ file, hedgehog.obj, represents the hedgehog model, showcasing detailed anatomical features and realistic textures. The image file, pencils.png, displays the colorful pencils arranged in a radial pattern, highlighting their vibrant colors and wooden texture.
