The new image features a hybrid character combining elements of Dragon Balls and Mega Man. The character retains the humanoid, robotic form of Mega Man with its sleek, blue body armor and large arm cannon. However, the armor is now adorned with vibrant orange spheres, each featuring star-shaped cutouts reminiscent of the Dragon Balls. These spheres are integrated into the design, appearing on the character's chest, shoulders, and knees, adding a mystical and powerful element. The helmet still has the distinctive crest, but it also incorporates the orange and star motif, creating a unique blend of both original designs. The overall appearance is a fusion of agility and mysticism, with the character standing against a plain background that highlights its striking features.
The images, Dragon_Balls.png and MegaMan.png, represent these respective elements. The Dragon Balls image showcases an orange sphere with star-shaped cutouts, while the Mega Man image displays a blue, robotic character with a futuristic design.
