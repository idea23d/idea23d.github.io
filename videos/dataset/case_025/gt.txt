The 3D model now features a humanoid robot equipped with a jetpack, enhancing its functional and futuristic design. The robot maintains its robust mechanical build, with a broad torso, articulated arms, and sturdy legs, suggesting durability and mobility. The head remains integrated into the torso, preserving its streamlined and utilitarian appearance. The newly added jetpack is seamlessly attached to the robot's back, complementing its metallic surface with a similar matte finish and gray color scheme. This addition suggests enhanced capabilities for flight or rapid movement, making the robot suitable for various tasks, from exploration to combat. 
The OBJ file, robot.obj, represents the original robotic figure, characterized by its armored build and functional design. The modifications include the integration of the jetpack, which aligns with the robot's industrial aesthetic and mission-oriented features.
