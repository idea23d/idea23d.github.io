The 3D model now features a fish with a skin texture and pattern resembling that of the watermelon in the image. The fish maintains its streamlined, elongated shape with a vertically compressed body and prominent fins, including a dorsal fin, pectoral fins, a symmetrical tail fin, and an anal fin. The head remains pointed with eyes on each side and a distinct mouth, preserving the model's stylized design. The new texture mimics the watermelonâ€™s outer rind, displaying green with dark green stripes, effectively blending realism with a creative twist. This transformation results in a unique and visually striking fish model, combining aquatic and fruity elements.
The OBJ file, fish.obj, represents the original fish model with detailed anatomical features, while the image a_o_2.png provides the visual reference for the watermelon skin texture, showcasing a spherical fruit with a green rind and red flesh.
