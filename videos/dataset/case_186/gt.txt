The 3D model now features a chair with butterfly wings, combining the classic design of a wooden chair with the vibrant aesthetics of butterfly wings. The chair retains its minimalist and sturdy structure, featuring a solid backrest, flat seat, straight armrests, and angled legs, all showcasing a natural wood finish. Attached to the backrest are the butterfly wings, adding an element of whimsy and color. The wings display a stunning blend of deep blue, turquoise, and white on the upper sections, transitioning into bright orange and yellow with intricate black patterns on the lower sections. This fusion creates a visually striking and unique piece, merging functionality with artistic flair.
