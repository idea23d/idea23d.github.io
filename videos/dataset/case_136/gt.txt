The 3D model now features a mirrored picture frame, combining elements from both the mirror and picture frame models. The picture frame retains its ornate rectangular shape with intricate, wavy patterns along the edges, suggesting a classic or antique aesthetic. The central area, originally intended for displaying a picture, is now occupied by the cylindrical mirror model. The mirror, with its flat circular faces, adds a reflective, glossy surface to the frame, enhancing its decorative appeal. The light blue or cyan coloration of the mirror's reflective surface contrasts with the darker, opaque material on its sides, creating an intriguing visual effect. The back of the frame remains solid, possibly with a stand or hook mechanism, although not visibly detailed. This transformation results in a unique, elegant piece combining traditional and modern elements through the use of reflective materials. The OBJ files, mirror.obj and picture_frame.obj, represent these respective models. The mirror model is a simplistic cylinder with smooth, reflective qualities, while the picture frame model showcases an ornate border with classic design features.
