The 3D model now features an umbrella with a Charmander-themed design, incorporating a flame tail element. The umbrella's canopy remains open and smooth, maintaining its original rounded shape and light coloration. The structural elements, such as ribs and stretchers, continue to support the canopy effectively. The central shaft and ergonomic handle retain their classic design, offering a comfortable grip. However, the standout feature is the addition of 'Charmander's flame tail,' which has been creatively integrated into the umbrella's design. This fiery element adds a vibrant, dynamic touch, giving the umbrella a playful and unique appearance reminiscent of the popular Pok√©mon character Charmander. The OBJ file, umbrella.obj, represents this detailed umbrella model, showcasing its realistic components and structure. The Charmander's flame tail adds an imaginative twist, making the umbrella both functional and visually striking.
