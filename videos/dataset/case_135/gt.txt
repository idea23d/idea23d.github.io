The 3D model now features an all-in-one notebook and pen holder, creatively integrating the pen into the notebook design. The notebook retains its original spiral-bound structure with a white front cover and a black back cover, characteristic of a standard notebook. The spiral binding is visible from the left and right views, allowing the pages to turn easily. The pen, with its sleek and cylindrical body, is seamlessly incorporated into the notebook, possibly attached through the spiral binding or designed to fit within a dedicated slot or holder on the notebook's cover. The pen maintains its smooth, metallic appearance with a conical writing tip and a clip on the side. This combination results in a functional and cohesive hybrid model, merging the practical elements of a notebook and a pen into a single, convenient accessory. The OBJ files, notebook.obj and pen.obj, represent these respective models. The notebook model showcases a typical spiral-bound design with a minimalistic aesthetic, while the pen model highlights a streamlined and professional structure.
