The 3D model now features a house with an added fourth floor, enhancing its original classic design. The new floor maintains the architectural symmetry and style of the existing structure, seamlessly integrating with the pitched roof and gabled front. The additional level includes symmetrically placed windows that match those on the lower floors, preserving the balanced aesthetic and allowing for natural light. The house retains its inviting front porch supported by columns, and the overall structure remains consistent with traditional architectural styles. The transformation results in a grander residential home with increased height and presence.

The OBJ file, house.obj, represents this model. Initially, it depicted a two-story house with a classic design, featuring a pitched roof, gabled front, and symmetrical window placement. The detailed architectural elements, such as the decorative gable and covered porch, contribute to its traditional style. With the addition of a fourth floor, the model maintains these characteristics while expanding vertically.
