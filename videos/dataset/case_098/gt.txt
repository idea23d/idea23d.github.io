The 3D model now features a Jigglypuff-Snorlax hybrid, combining elements from both images. The hybrid retains Jigglypuff's round, pink body and cheerful expression, complete with large, expressive blue eyes and a small tuft of hair on the forehead. The pointy ears with black interiors and pink blush marks on the cheeks are also present. However, the hybrid incorporates Snorlax's smooth, blue exterior and cream-colored belly, giving it a unique two-toned coloration. The limbs are a mix of both creatures, featuring Jigglypuff's tiny, stubby arms and legs with Snorlax's small, clawed feet. The overall appearance is a playful and endearing fusion, capturing Jigglypuff's lively features and Snorlax's content demeanor. The images, Jigglypuff.png and Snorlax.png, represent these respective characters. Jigglypuff's image showcases a cute, round creature with a playful look, while Snorlax's image depicts a friendly character with a relaxed and cheerful expression.
