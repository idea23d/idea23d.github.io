The 3D model now showcases a house with a castle-style roof, blending rustic and medieval elements. The house retains its original quaint and cozy structure, featuring a gabled roof and wooden shingles. However, the roof has been transformed to mimic the grand architecture of a castle, adopting the conical shapes and intricate details typical of medieval turrets. This change adds an element of grandeur to the rustic house while maintaining its warm, traditional essence. The chimney, porch, and symmetrical windows remain intact, preserving the house's balanced aesthetic. Meanwhile, the castle-style roof introduces an asymmetrical silhouette with its varying heights and conical forms, enhancing the overall complexity of the model. The transformation results in a unique fusion of a rustic house with an elaborate castle roof, creating a charming and distinctive architectural hybrid.
The OBJ files, house.obj and castle.obj, represent these respective models. The house model displays a traditional structure with rustic textures, while the castle model showcases a complex, detailed design with stone textures and medieval features.
