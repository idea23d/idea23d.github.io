The new hybrid design features a wand that combines elements of Magical Girl Madoka's wand and the Dragon Balls, resulting in a unique and enchanting creation. The wand retains its original slender and ornate structure, with a predominantly pink shaft and a glossy finish. At the top, the five-pointed star has been creatively integrated with the Dragon Ball's signature bright orange sphere and star-shaped cutouts. This fusion results in a wand with a glowing, dynamic top that combines the magical essence of the star with the iconic look of Dragon Balls. The golden decorative elements remain intact at the base of the star, adding to the wand's regal and mystical appearance. The combination of pink, gold, and orange hues creates a visually striking and powerful magical object.
