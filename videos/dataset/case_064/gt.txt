The 3D model now features a giraffe adorned with denim-like spots, adding a unique twist to the traditional giraffe pattern. The original giraffe model maintains its distinctive long neck, slender legs, and small head with ossicones, characteristic of the species. The elongated body and slightly curved neck give the giraffe a lifelike posture. The spots, however, have been transformed to resemble patches of denim, incorporating various shades of blue that mimic the texture and appearance of denim fabric. This creative alteration results in a striking visual contrast against the giraffe's natural anatomy. 

The OBJ file, giraffe.obj, represents the detailed anatomical structure of the giraffe, capturing its tall stature and unique features. The image, denim_spots.png, provides the pattern for the denim-like spots, characterized by overlapping blue rectangles and squares that create a textured denim appearance. Together, these elements combine to form a playful and imaginative depiction of a giraffe with denim-inspired spots.
