The 3D model now features a fantasy castle with towers shaped like mushrooms, blending whimsical elements with medieval architecture. The castle retains its original structure with pointed rooftops and various tower heights, but each tower is now topped with a mushroom cap. These caps are inspired by the mushroom image, showcasing vivid orange-red colors with white speckles and a soft blue glow underneath. The magical mushrooms replace the traditional spires, adding a fantastical touch to the castle's silhouette. The rocky, forested terrain surrounding the castle enhances the mystical atmosphere, with lush greenery and rugged landscapes. The transformation results in a unique and enchanting castle that combines elements of fantasy with realistic architectural details.

The OBJ file, castle.obj, represents the original castle model with its medieval design and intricate details. The mushroom image, mushroom.png, provides the inspiration for the mushroom-shaped towers, featuring glowing caps set against a mystical forest backdrop.
