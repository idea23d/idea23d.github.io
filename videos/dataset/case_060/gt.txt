The 3D model now features an elephant with ears that resemble fluffy clouds, maintaining the original anatomical structure of the elephant. The elephant's large, rounded body and prominent head remain intact, with a long, downward-curving trunk. The cloud ears replace the original elephant ears, adopting the thick, billowy appearance of cumulus clouds, with bright white tops and shadowed undersides. This transformation gives the elephant a whimsical and ethereal look, as if its ears are made of soft, floating clouds. The entire scene retains the elephant's lifelike posture and robust form, while the cloud ears add a surreal touch. The OBJ file, elephant.obj, captures the elephant's realistic structure and details, while the image cloud_ears.png provides the dramatic cloud texture and appearance for the ears.
