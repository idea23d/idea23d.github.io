The 3D model has been transformed into a dynamic fountain featuring a shark. The shark's streamlined, torpedo-shaped body is oriented in a vertical position to simulate the effect of water flowing upwards through the model. The prominent dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and crescent-shaped caudal fin enhance the dynamic appearance, as if the shark is leaping out of the water. The conical head, with its pointed snout and wide mouth showing sharp teeth, is positioned towards the top, creating the illusion of water shooting out from its open mouth. The smooth texture and gray coloration with a lighter underside remain intact, adding to the realistic depiction of the shark. The visible gill slits are maintained for added detail. The transformation results in a striking and imaginative fountain design that captures the essence of a shark in motion.
The OBJ file, shark.obj, represents the detailed shark model, showcasing its anatomical features, smooth texture, and realistic marine coloration.
