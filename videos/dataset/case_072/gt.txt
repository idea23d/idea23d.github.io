The 3D model now showcases a robot designed to appear as if it is constructed from old, rusty metal. The robot maintains a humanoid form with a robust, mechanical design. Its head is small and box-like, featuring a circular element suggesting a sensor or camera. The torso is rectangular and solid, resembling a metal block, while the arms and legs are segmented with cylindrical joints, ending in three-fingered hands and large, rounded feet for stability. The entire model is covered in a metallic texture with a worn, rusted appearance, characterized by dark shades of brown and gray, enhancing its industrial and aged look. The integration of the rusty metal texture from the image adds an authentic weathered finish to the robot, emphasizing its ruggedness and resilience. The OBJ file, robot.obj, represents the stylized robot model, and the image rusty_metal.png provides the rusted texture that gives the robot its distinctive, corroded appearance.
