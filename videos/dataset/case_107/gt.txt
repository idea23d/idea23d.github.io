The resulting hybrid outfit combines elements from both the Sailor Venus and Sailor Saturn designs, creating a unique ensemble that blends their distinct styles. The character retains the long, flowing blonde hair styled into buns with red ornaments from Sailor Venus, paired with the short, dark hair elements of Sailor Saturn, creating a dynamic new hairstyle. The outfit integrates the white sailor-style top with a purple collar from Sailor Saturn, adorned with a large blue bow from Sailor Venus and a golden brooch from Venus. The skirt is a combination of both designs, featuring a layered look with the orange base of Sailor Venus and the pleated purple overlay from Sailor Saturn. Footwear is a fusion of styles, with the orange boots from Venus incorporating the red and purple band details from Saturn. The gloves are white and extend past the elbows, featuring the red bands of Venus with the purple accents of Saturn. Accessories include the golden tiara with a red jewel and the purple choker from Sailor Saturn, while maintaining the confident expression and blue eyes of Sailor Venus. The resulting outfit is a vibrant and colorful anime-style hybrid, capturing the essence of both characters.
