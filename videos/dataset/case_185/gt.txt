The 3D model now features a phone with a turtle shell-themed case, seamlessly integrating the unique design elements of the turtle. The phone retains its original sleek, modern shape with rounded edges and a slim profile, but the back of the phone is now adorned with the turtle shell's bold black and orange striped pattern. This shell adds a textured, bumpy surface, enhancing the case's grip and providing a visually striking contrast to the smooth front screen. The turtle shell design is meticulously detailed, incorporating the vivid colors and lifelike appearance of the turtle from the image. The phone's functionality remains unchanged, with the front touchscreen, camera module, and side buttons still accessible. The transformation results in a creative and eye-catching turtle-themed phone case.
