The 3D model now features a rabbit with banana-shaped ears, retaining its original sitting posture. The rabbit's body continues to exhibit a realistic, rounded form with a soft fur texture and small, rounded tail. The rabbit's head remains proportionate with a small nose and lifelike eyes, while the ears have been creatively replaced by banana models. These banana ears maintain their elongated, curved shape with a smooth texture and vibrant yellow color, akin to ripe bananas. The rabbitâ€™s sitting position is preserved, with its front legs close together and hind legs tucked under the body. This transformation results in a whimsical and unique hybrid creature that humorously combines the features of a rabbit and bananas.
The OBJ files, rabbit.obj and banana.obj, represent these respective models. The rabbit model showcases a detailed anatomical structure with realistic textures and colors, while the banana model presents a smooth, curved, and vividly yellow form.
