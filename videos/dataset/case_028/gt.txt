The 3D model now features a building design that incorporates the rustic texture of a brick wall with the sleek, modern architectural style depicted in the original image. The building maintains its multi-story, contemporary aesthetic with clean lines and large glass panels, but now the facade is enhanced with the staggered pattern and earthy tones of the brick texture. The bricks add a warm and textured appearance, contrasting with the reflective and transparent glass elements. The various terraces and balconies remain, some enclosed with glass railings, now juxtaposed with the natural brick texture. The overall design retains its geometric sophistication and minimalist appearance, while the brick texture adds a unique, rustic charm. The transformation results in a harmonious blend of modern architecture with a classic brick aesthetic. The images, texture.png and architecture.png, represent these respective elements: the close-up view of the brick wall with its warm tones and rough surface, and the modern multi-story building with its sleek, reflective facade.
