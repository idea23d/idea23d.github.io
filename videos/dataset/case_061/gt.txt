The 3D model now features a penguin with a body that appears to be made of ice, while retaining its realistic proportions and features. The penguin's overall shape remains rounded and smooth, with its flipper-like wings tucked close to the body and feet positioned in a standard penguin stance. However, the traditional black and white color scheme has been replaced by a translucent ice texture, giving the penguin a unique and striking appearance. The ice body exhibits jagged, irregular crystal formations with sharp edges, allowing light to pass through and cast a soft blue hue, mimicking the natural texture and appearance of ice. The transformation results in a visually captivating hybrid of a penguin with an ice-like body.
The OBJ file, penguin.obj, represents the realistic penguin model, while the image ice_body.png provides the ice texture, contributing to the penguin's transformed appearance.
