The 3D model now features a chair with a seat designed to resemble a seashell, combining elegance with a touch of the ocean's charm. The chair maintains its sculptural and modern form, with an oval, slightly reclined backrest that provides ergonomic support. The seat, inspired by the seashell design, mimics the spiral shape and gradient of soft blue and white hues typical of the large shell in the image. This unique seat design adds a distinct texture and visual interest to the chair, echoing the natural aesthetics of seashells. The legs remain splayed outwards for stability, preserving the chair's contemporary silhouette. The transformation results in a functional yet artistic piece of furniture that harmoniously blends modern design with nature-inspired elements.
