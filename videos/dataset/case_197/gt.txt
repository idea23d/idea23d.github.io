The 3D model now features a fountain with phoenix-themed elements, integrating the mythical bird's vibrant characteristics into the classical structure. The fountain retains its multi-tiered design with cascading water, but now includes detailed phoenix motifs. The topmost tier is adorned with a depiction of the phoenix perched majestically, its wings spread wide and tail flowing, capturing the essence of fire and rebirth. The phoenix's feathers exhibit a vibrant mix of orange, yellow, and red, resembling flames, and are intricately detailed to maintain a lifelike texture. The bird's sharp beak and black, curved horns add to its mythical appearance, while its bright, piercing eyes enhance its majestic presence.
