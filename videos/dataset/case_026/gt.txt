The 3D model now features a chair with added angular elements, altering its previously smooth and rounded design. The original sleek, curved form with a wide arching backrest has been modified to include more defined angles, giving the chair a more geometric and contemporary appearance. The smooth, continuous surface is now punctuated by sharp lines and edges, adding a modern twist to its minimalist aesthetic. The seating area maintains its broad base, but now with angular contours that contrast with the previous semi-circular design. The backrest, while still providing support, showcases a more angular transition from the sides to the base, enhancing the chair's structural appeal. The texture remains smooth, resembling polished material, but the new angles introduce a dynamic visual interest.

The OBJ file, bench.obj, originally represented a modern, curvilinear piece of furniture with a seamless design. Post-editing, it retains its ergonomic qualities but with added angular features that transform its style into a more edgy, contemporary look.
