The 3D model now features a Bulbasaur planter, creatively combining the original Bulbasaur design with a plant-themed element. The Bulbasaur retains its cartoonish dinosaur-like appearance, with a light green body adorned with darker green spots. It has large red eyes with white pupils and a small triangular mouth, maintaining its cute and friendly expression. The creature stands on four short legs, each with three white claws, and has a rounded body and small tail. The addition of a plant-themed design transforms the large green bulb on its back into a planter, creating a unique and whimsical object ideal for holding small plants or succulents. The overall design merges the playful character of Bulbasaur with functional plant-holding capabilities.
