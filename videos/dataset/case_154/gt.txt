The 3D model now features a rocket-themed battery, seamlessly merging the cylindrical structure of a battery with the stylized elements of a rocket. The cylindrical body of the battery retains its metallic gray color and smooth texture, resembling a traditional battery. However, it now incorporates the tapered nose cone and red tip of the rocket model, giving it a dynamic and futuristic appearance. The bottom of the battery is enhanced with the rocket's three dark fins and a red exhaust nozzle, adding to its aerodynamic and launch-ready look. This creative combination results in a unique and visually striking hybrid that blends the utilitarian design of a battery with the imaginative aesthetics of a classic rocket.

The OBJ files, battery.obj and Rocket.obj, represent these respective models. The battery model is a simple cylindrical form with a metallic finish, while the rocket model features a sleek, tapered design with distinct color accents and aerodynamic fins.
