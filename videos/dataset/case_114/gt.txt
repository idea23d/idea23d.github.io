The 3D model now features a Poké Ball with integrated storage functionality, maintaining its iconic design. The top half remains red and the bottom half white, with the familiar black band and central white button. However, the Poké Ball now includes an innovative storage mechanism, allowing it to open and store items securely within its spherical structure. The design cleverly integrates the new functionality while preserving the Poké Ball's classic appearance, making it both practical and visually appealing. The image, Pokeball.png, depicts this enhanced Poké Ball, showcasing its traditional red-and-white color scheme and button, set against a plain white background.
