The 3D model now features a fountain that appears to be made of glass, incorporating elements from the original fountain design and the texture from the glass image. The fountain maintains its classic tiered structure with a broad, shallow basin at the base and a smaller tier above, both overflowing with a translucent glass-like appearance. The original stone or marble texture is replaced by a smooth, frosted glass texture, showcasing swirling patterns that mimic flowing water, akin to the vase in the image. The glass effect adds a gradient of soft colors, primarily light blue and green, giving the fountain an ethereal and calming presence. The intricate patterns and fluting on the basin edges and pedestal are now highlighted by the translucent quality, enhancing its elegance. The overall symmetrical and circular form of the fountain remains intact, now with a luminous and delicate glass quality. The OBJ file, fountain.obj, represents the original fountain model, now transformed with the glass.png texture, which depicts a translucent, frosted glass vase with swirling patterns and a soft color gradient.
