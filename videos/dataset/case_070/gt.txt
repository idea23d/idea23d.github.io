The jacket now features a texture inspired by dragon scales, combining the original sleek style with a mythical flare. The jacket retains its metallic silver color and modern, edgy look, but the surface is now covered with a pattern resembling dragon scales. These scales are arranged in a diamond-like pattern, with a gradient of colors transitioning from green to blue to purple, adding a fantastical element to the garment. The texture appears three-dimensional, with vein-like beige structures creating a lattice effect that enhances the complexity of the design. This transformation results in a unique and eye-catching piece that blends contemporary fashion with mythical inspiration. 

The images, jacket.png and dragon_scales.png, represent these respective elements. The jacket image showcases a stylish man in a metallic silver jacket against a neutral background, while the dragon scales image displays a colorful, intricate pattern reminiscent of mythical creatures.
