The 3D model now features a tank with car wheels replacing its original tracks, maintaining the classic tank design with an armored body and turret. The robust, rectangular chassis and centrally located turret with a long cannon are preserved. However, the tracked suspension system has been replaced by rugged vehicle tires, which have a deep tread pattern and a detailed rim design. These car wheels provide a distinct contrast to the traditional tank appearance, adding an off-road or heavy-duty aesthetic. The overall color scheme remains muted, typical for military vehicles, ensuring a realistic representation.

The OBJ files, tank.obj and wheel.obj, represent these respective models. The tank model showcases a detailed and realistic depiction of a traditional armored vehicle, while the wheel model features a heavily treaded, durable tire designed for challenging terrains.
