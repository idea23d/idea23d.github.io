The 3D model now showcases a dragon with a body that resembles volcanic rock, giving it a unique and striking appearance. The dragon maintains its dynamic posture, standing on a rocky base that suggests stability. Its head features sharp horns and an intense expression, while the serpentine neck connects to a fierce face with an open mouth and visible teeth. The large, bat-like wings are spread out, adding to its majestic aura. The body is robust, covered in textured scales that mimic the dark, cracked surface of volcanic rock, interspersed with glowing fissures similar to those seen in the volcanic landscape image. The muscular limbs end in powerful claws, and the tail is long and tapering, completing the dynamic pose. The addition of volcanic rock texture and glowing fissures enhances the mythical and fearsome look of the dragon.
The OBJ file, dragon.obj, provides a detailed depiction of this mythical creature, while the image volcanic_rock.png offers the visual inspiration for the textured, rock-like surface of the dragon's body.
