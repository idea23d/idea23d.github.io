The resulting 3D model is a Pikachu-themed cup coaster, creatively combining elements of both original models. The base of the model is the classic cup coaster, featuring a cylindrical mug with a smooth surface and a handle, all placed on a round, darker coaster. The Pikachu influence is integrated into the design by incorporating Pikachu's distinctive features onto the coaster. The coaster's surface now displays Pikachu's bright yellow color, large round eyes, red cheek markings, and the iconic lightning bolt-shaped tail. The ears, with their long, pointed shape and black tips, are cleverly positioned to appear as decorative elements on the coaster. This fusion results in a playful and functional piece, perfect for fans of the beloved character. The OBJ files, cup_coaster.obj and Pikachu.obj, represent these respective models. The cup coaster model showcases a minimalistic and practical design, while the Pikachu model captures a cute and expressive cartoonish form.
