The 3D model now features a robot with armor that appears to be crafted from crystalline ice, combining the futuristic design of the original robot with the ethereal qualities of ice crystals. The robot maintains its robust, humanoid build with symmetrical limbs and a central body. The head and torso are streamlined, and the arms remain muscular with blade-like extensions. The crystalline ice armor covers the robot, giving it a translucent, shimmering appearance that mimics the intricate, feather-like structures of frost crystals. The cool blue and warm orange hues from the ice crystal image add a striking contrast to the robot's design, enhancing its aggressive and futuristic aesthetic. The transformation results in a visually captivating hybrid of technology and nature, reminiscent of a warrior encased in ice.
