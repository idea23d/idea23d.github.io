The 3D model now features a hybrid character combining elements of Totoro and Doraemon's Take-copter. The resulting creature maintains Totoro's round, gray body and playful demeanor, complete with its signature beige belly and triangle-like markings. Totoro's small eyes, round nose, and wide mouth remain intact, along with its pointed ears. However, the green umbrella it typically holds has been replaced by the addition of the Take-copter's distinctive propellers. These propellers, attached to the top of the head, suggest the ability to fly, transforming Totoro into a whimsical flying creature. 

The images, Totoro_umbrella.png and Doraemon_Take_copter.png, depict these original characters. The Totoro image showcases a large, friendly creature with a playful expression, while the Doraemon image features a blue, round robot character with a propeller system for flying. This combination results in a unique and imaginative hybrid character, blending the charming aspects of both Totoro and the Take-copter.
