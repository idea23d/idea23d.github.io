The combined image now features a fusion of Goku and Charmander, merging the distinctive traits of both characters. The resulting character retains Goku's spiky black hair and confident posture, along with the iconic orange gi and blue wristbands. However, the gi is modified to accommodate Charmander's dinosaur-like features, including the orange body and cream-colored underside. The character's eyes are large and expressive, blending Goku's anime style with Charmander's playful blue eyes. Additionally, the character has Charmander's short arms and legs, each with three white claws, and a tail with a bright flame at the tip. This fusion results in a whimsical and unique character, combining the strength and confidence of Goku with the cute and friendly appearance of Charmander.

The PNG files, Goku.png and Charmander.png, represent these respective characters. Goku is depicted in a vibrant anime style with a bold outfit and confident stance, while Charmander appears as a cute, dinosaur-like creature with a cheerful demeanor and distinctive fiery tail.
