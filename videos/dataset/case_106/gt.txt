The resulting design is a hybrid Sailor Mars-Jupiter outfit that combines elements from both original designs. The new outfit features a blend of the vibrant red and green colors, creating a striking visual contrast. The top incorporates the sleeveless design and sailor-style collar from Sailor Mars, adorned with a mix of yellow and green trims. The large bow at the front combines the red circular brooch from Sailor Jupiter with the blue jewel-like embellishment from Sailor Mars, creating a unique focal point. The skirt merges the flowing style of Sailor Mars with the pleated design of Sailor Jupiter, resulting in a dynamic silhouette. The overall look is completed with green gloves featuring bow details and a gold tiara with a combined green and blue gem, harmonizing the two styles.
