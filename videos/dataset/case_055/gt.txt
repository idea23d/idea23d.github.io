The 3D model now features a bike with a frame designed to resemble interwoven rope, giving it a unique and artistic appearance. The original bike's modern, streamlined structure remains intact, with smooth, curved lines connecting the wheels, seat, and handlebars. However, the frame now appears as if crafted from thick, braided ropes, adding a textured and organic feel to the design. The wheels maintain their solid, disk-like aesthetics with stylized spokes, while the handlebars and seat retain their ergonomic and minimalist designs, respectively. The pedals and chain mechanism continue to indicate functionality, integrating seamlessly with the rope-like frame. The overall color scheme of the bike model enhances this rope texture, creating an interesting contrast between the natural fibrous look of the ropes and the bike's sleek, modern elements. 

The OBJ file, bike.obj, represents this bicycle model with a futuristic yet organic twist. The accompanying image, rope.png, displays several thick, intertwined ropes with a braided texture and natural beige color. These elements are integrated into the bike model to create a cohesive and imaginative representation.
