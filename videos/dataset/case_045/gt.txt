The 3D model now represents a bookshelf designed to mimic the twisting shape of a DNA helix. The bookshelf maintains its artistic and organic form, with interconnected, rounded shapes and an open design featuring two central holes. The model's surface texture suggests inspiration from natural formations, while the overall structure embodies the elegant twisting strands of a DNA helix. The bookshelf's profile remains relatively flat with subtle edge undulations, consistent with the naturalistic aesthetic. The top and bottom views reveal a rectangular shape, allowing it to function as a freestanding piece. The transformation captures the dynamic and complex form of a DNA helix, providing a unique and visually striking bookshelf design.
The OBJ file, bookshelf.obj, represents this sculptural model, combining modern art elements with a naturalistic style. The accompanying image, dna_helix.png, depicts a stylized DNA double helix, with intertwined strands in vibrant blue and orange, highlighting the elegant and complex genetic structure.
