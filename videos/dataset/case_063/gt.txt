The 3D model now features a chameleon that changes colors to mimic various fabric patterns, resulting in a dynamic and visually striking creature. The chameleon maintains its realistic shape and structure, with a curled tail, prominent head, and limbs gripping a branch. The original vivid green and yellow hues are replaced by the detailed floral patterns from the image, creating a chameleon that appears to blend seamlessly with its environment. The patterns include large, intricately designed flowers in shades of red, peach, and light grey on a dark blue background, giving the chameleon a vibrant and artistic appearance. The transformation highlights the chameleon's natural ability to adapt and camouflage, enhanced by the rich and elegant tapestry-like effect of the fabric patterns. The OBJ file, chameleon.obj, represents the detailed 3D model of the chameleon, while the IMG file, fabric_patterns.png, showcases the intricate floral design used to alter the chameleon's appearance.
