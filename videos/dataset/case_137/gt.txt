The umbrella retains its classic dome-like canopy, supported by metallic ribs, with a smooth and taut fabric. The traditional J-shaped handle is evident from both left and right views, providing easy gripping. Meanwhile, the rain shoes are depicted as turquoise rubber boots with black soles, designed for functional use in wet conditions. They have a mid-calf height, smooth design, and textured soles for grip. The combination results in a visually cohesive set, ideal for rainy weather. The OBJ files, umbrella.obj and rain_shoes.obj, represent these respective models. The umbrella model displays a detailed structural and aesthetic design, while the rain shoes model showcases practical, durable footwear with a vibrant color.
