The 3D model now features a squirrel with a tail that appears to be made of stars, while maintaining the original sitting posture. The squirrel's body retains its realistic stance, with smooth fur texture and natural brown coloration. The front paws are held near its chest, and its ears remain prominent and slightly pointed. However, the tail has been transformed to resemble a starry sky, with a shimmering, celestial appearance that contrasts beautifully with the rest of the squirrel's body. The transformation adds a whimsical and enchanting element to the model, creating a unique blend of realism and fantasy. The OBJ file, squirrel.obj, represents the original squirrel model with its lifelike features, now enhanced with a magical, star-filled tail.
