The new image features a hybrid character combining elements of Chibi Maruko-chan and the Blue Cat. The resulting character maintains the large head and small body of the chibi style, with short black hair and big, shiny eyes from Chibi Maruko-chan. However, the skin tone and facial details incorporate the vibrant blue color of the Blue Cat, including its large, expressive eyes and wide smile. The character's outfit blends elements from both sources, with the traditional Japanese school uniform from Chibi Maruko-chan but in the blue hue of the cat's fur. The hybrid character also features a fluffy blue tail and pink inner ears, staying true to the Blue Cat's design. The background remains plain, allowing the unique fusion character to stand out. 

The images Chibi_Maruko.png and Blue_Cat.png represent these respective characters. Chibi_Maruko.png showcases a chibi-style character with a school uniform, while Blue_Cat.png displays a cheerful blue cat with expressive features and a playful demeanor.
