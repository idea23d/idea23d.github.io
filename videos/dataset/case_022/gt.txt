The 3D model now features a griffin, a mythical creature combining elements of both a lion and an eagle. The model incorporates the body, limbs, and tail of a lion with the head, wings, and talons of an eagle. The lion's robust and muscular build is preserved, showcasing its powerful stance. Its majestic mane flows around the neck, while the body remains elongated and graceful. The eagle's wings are fully spread, displaying intricate feather details and adding a dynamic, aerial aspect to the model. The head of the griffin features the eagle's prominent beak and sharp eyes, contributing to a regal and fierce appearance. The combination results in a creature with the strength of a lion and the grace of an eagle, standing proudly with wings poised for flight.

The OBJ files, lion.obj and eagle.obj, represent these respective models. The lion model displays a detailed muscular structure and textured mane, while the eagle model showcases a wide wingspan with detailed feathering and a streamlined form.
