The new image features a hybrid character combining elements of My Melody and Kumamon. The character retains the black, round body and small limbs of Kumamon, but now has the white, rounded face and distinctive features of My Melody. The face includes black oval eyes, a yellow oval nose, and the signature pink bow on the left ear. Additionally, the character has Kumamon's tan-colored muzzle and belly, with the playful red circles on the cheeks, blending both characters' traits. The hybrid character stands upright, combining the charm and approachability of Kumamon with the iconic, cute elements of My Melody.
The PNG files, My_Melody.png and Kumamon.png, represent these respective characters. The My Melody image showcases the classic Hello Kitty appearance with a pink color scheme, while the Kumamon image depicts a friendly, cartoon-style bear with red cheek accents and a tan muzzle.
