The 3D model now features a tree with golden eagle wings, seamlessly integrated into its structure. The central trunk and bare branches maintain their stylized, organic form and dark brown coloration, suggesting a winter-like tree. However, the addition of the eagle wings adds a dynamic and majestic element to the model. The wings are fully spread, showcasing detailed feathers and a golden hue, which contrast with the tree's earthy tones, adding a regal quality. The symmetry of the wings enhances the tree's aesthetic, as they extend from either side of the trunk, creating a striking visual effect. 

The image and OBJ file used in this transformation are golden_eagle.png and tree.obj, respectively. The golden eagle image captures the powerful and noble essence of the bird with its detailed feathers and focused expression, while the tree model is a stylized representation emphasizing form and simplicity. This combination results in a unique hybrid model of a tree with eagle wings.
