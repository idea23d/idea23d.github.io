The 3D model now features a towel integrated with Doraemon's gadget designs, maintaining its original folded form. The towel retains its realistic texture and fabric-like material, with a light, neutral color typical of home textiles. However, it now incorporates elements inspired by Doraemon's gadgets, seamlessly blending technology with the soft, flexible structure of the towel. These gadgets are subtly embedded within the towel's folds, adding a whimsical and futuristic aspect to the model. The towel's compact and layered appearance remains intact, but it now serves a dual purpose with its unique gadget features. The OBJ file, towel.obj, represents the original textile model, showcasing its detailed woven texture and fold structure. The addition of Doraemon's gadgets transforms it into a playful and imaginative piece, combining everyday practicality with cartoon-inspired innovation.
