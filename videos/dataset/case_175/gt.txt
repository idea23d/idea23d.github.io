The 3D model now features a Bulbasaur-themed notebook, combining the original spiral-bound notebook with the iconic plant bulb characteristic of Bulbasaur. The notebook maintains its minimalist design with a white front cover and black back cover, along with the robust black spiral binding on the left side. The plant bulb is elegantly integrated into the design, adding a unique thematic element. The bulb's texture and color resemble Bulbasaur's distinct green bulb, enhancing the notebook's aesthetic with a playful and creative twist. The addition of the plant bulb transforms the notebook into a charming, Pok√©mon-inspired item. 

The OBJ file, notebook.obj, represents the spiral-bound notebook model. It showcases a simple yet functional design with white and black covers, and a sturdy spiral binding. The Bulbasaur's plant bulb, although not provided as an OBJ file, is conceptually added to this model, giving it a distinctive and imaginative flair.
