The 3D model now features a sculpture that resembles melting ice cream, combining elements from both the 3D model and the image. The sculpture maintains the classic soft-serve swirl from the original 3D model, with its smooth, creamy texture and a glossy sheen, giving it a realistic appearance. The ice cream is depicted in various colors, inspired by the vibrant hues from the image, including pink, purple, blue, and green, with a slightly melting effect at the base that forms a small puddle. The waffle cone retains its textured surface and light brown color, providing a realistic foundation for the melting sculpture. This transformation captures the whimsical and colorful essence of the image, resulting in a playful, eye-catching sculpture that looks as though itâ€™s made of melting ice cream. The OBJ file, sculpture.obj, represents the original ice cream cone model, while the image, melting_ice_cream.png, offers inspiration with its colorful, melting ice cream cones.
