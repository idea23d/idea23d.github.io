The 3D model now features a traditional table lamp adorned with vibrant butterfly wings. The lamp maintains its classic design, with a bell-shaped, warm beige shade that creates a cozy ambiance. The body remains curvy and urn-like, made from a dark material, while the base provides stability with its round shape. However, the addition of butterfly wings, inspired by the image, introduces a striking visual element. The wings exhibit a rich color palette, with upper wings in dark brown transitioning to blue, and lower wings in orange and yellow with black accents. The intricate patterns and vibrant colors of the wings contrast with the lamp's earthy tones, resulting in a unique and eye-catching combination. The OBJ file, lamp.obj, represents the lamp model, while the image, butterfly_wings.png, showcases the detailed and colorful butterfly design that enhances the lamp's aesthetic.
