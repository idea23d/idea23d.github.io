The 3D model now features a Charizard-themed candle, incorporating flame motifs into its design. The original Charizard image depicted a cartoon-style, dragon-like creature with an orange body, cream-colored underbelly, and blue inner wings. It stood upright on two legs, had two small arms with three claws each, large expressive eyes, a long snout, and a tail ending with a flame. The new candle design captures these elements by integrating flame motifs, creating a whimsical and thematic representation. The candle maintains the orange and cream color scheme, with blue accents mimicking Charizard's wings. The flame motifs are cleverly incorporated, possibly at the top of the candle or along its sides, echoing the creature's fiery nature. The transformation results in a unique candle that pays homage to Charizard's iconic appearance.
The image file, Charizard.png, represents the original cartoon-style character with its distinct features and colors, which have been creatively adapted into the candle design.
