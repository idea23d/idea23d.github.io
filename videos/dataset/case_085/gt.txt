The new image combines Doraemon's 4D pocket with Pikachu, resulting in a playful fusion. The pocket, originally part of the blue, cat-like character with a red nose and big white eyes, now contains Pikachu. Pikachu's bright yellow body and distinctive features, such as its black-tipped ears, round black eyes, and red cheeks, are visible peeking out from the pouch. The character's lightning bolt-shaped tail, yellow with a brown base, is also incorporated into the design, adding a dynamic element. This creative blend results in a charming scene where Pikachu's cute and energetic appearance is seamlessly integrated into the 4D pocket of Doraemon, maintaining the cheerful and glossy aesthetic of the original design.

The images, Doraemon_fourD_pocket.png and Pikachu.png, represent these distinct characters. The Doraemon image displays a toy figure in bright and glossy colors, featuring a red-outlined pouch with colorful blocks, while the Pikachu image shows a cartoon character with a vibrant yellow body and playful expression.
