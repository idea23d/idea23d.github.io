The 3D model now features a functional bamboo copter inspired by the cartoonish character. The character retains its original design, with a primarily blue body, white face and stomach, and distinctive facial features such as large round eyes and a red nose. The round head is topped with a propeller, now designed to provide 'flying functionality,' enhancing the playful and whimsical nature of the model. The character sits on a small yellow platform with wheels, maintaining its toy-like appearance. This transformation results in a unique blend of cartoon charm and imagined functionality. The OBJ file, Doraemon_bamboo_copter.obj, represents this model, showcasing detailed features with clean lines and vibrant colors, emphasizing its animated aesthetic.
