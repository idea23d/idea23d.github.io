The 3D model now features a dragon with scales inspired by the texture of a pineapple, maintaining its original mythical and fierce appearance. The dragon's robust and muscular body is now covered with scales that mimic the spiky texture of a pineapple's skin. The vibrant golden-yellow color of the pineapple enhances the dragon's natural earthy tones, creating a striking and unique appearance. The two prominent heads, sharp teeth, and horns remain intact, while the bat-like wings, powerful legs, and long tapered tail emphasize its strength and agility. The transformation results in a fantastical creature that blends the mythical essence of a dragon with the tropical texture of a pineapple.

The OBJ file, dragon.obj, represents the dragon model with detailed anatomical features and a reptilian texture. The image, pineapple.png, provides the inspiration for the dragon's new scale texture, showcasing the rich, golden-yellow skin and spiky surface of a pineapple, along with its lush green leaves.
