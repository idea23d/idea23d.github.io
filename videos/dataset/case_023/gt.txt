The 3D model now features a winged unicorn, combining the elements of both the horse and unicorn models. The resulting creature maintains the realistic musculature and anatomy of the horse, including the elongated head, arched neck, and well-defined legs with hooves. The mane and tail of the horse model contribute to the unicorn's elegant appearance, with flowing textures that suggest movement. From the unicorn model, the defining single horn on the forehead is retained, along with the dynamic rearing pose, which adds a sense of motion and grace. Additionally, majestic wings have been incorporated, enhancing the mythical quality of the model. The combined model showcases a harmonious blend of both creatures, with the muscular detail of the horse and the magical elements of the unicorn, including the pale color and smooth texture typical of mythical unicorns. This transformation results in a captivating and powerful winged unicorn. 

The OBJ files, horse.obj and unicorn.obj, represent these respective models. The horse model provides a detailed and realistic equine structure, while the unicorn model contributes the magical horn, dynamic pose, and additional mystical elements.
