The 3D model now features a comb with Snorlax's sleepy face integrated into its design, creating a Snorlax-themed comb. The comb retains its elongated shape with a slender, ergonomic handle, slightly curved for comfort and featuring a hole for hanging. The head of the comb, originally rectangular with evenly spaced bristles, now includes the distinctive features of Snorlax's sleepy face, adding a playful and thematic element to the design. The Snorlax face blends seamlessly with the comb's overall structure, maintaining the practical functionality of the original model. The transformation results in a unique and whimsical grooming tool that reflects the beloved Pok√©mon's character. The OBJ file, comb.obj, represents this model, initially showcasing a simplistic and practical design that has been enhanced with Snorlax's facial features for added charm.
