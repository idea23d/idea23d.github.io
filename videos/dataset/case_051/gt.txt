The 3D model now features a chair with a seat designed to resemble a sunflower, combining organic and modern aesthetics. The chair retains its original design, with petal-like structures forming the backrest and sides, but the seat area now mimics the vibrant appearance of a sunflower. The seat's surface incorporates the rich, dark brown center and the golden yellow petals as seen in the sunflower image, complete with hints of orange and brown for added depth. This transformation enhances the chair's natural and inviting atmosphere while maintaining its cushioned comfort and stability. The side table remains unchanged, featuring a sleek, modern design with a decorative item on top. The OBJ file, chair.obj, represents this hybrid model, blending the chair's structural elements with the sunflower's vivid colors and patterns from sunflower.png.
