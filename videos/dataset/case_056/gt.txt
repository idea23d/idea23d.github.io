The 3D model now features a fish with scales resembling pieces of candy, maintaining its original vibrant and intricate design. The fish's body remains rounded, with a prominent dorsal fin, symmetrical anal fin, and a colorful fan-shaped tail fin. However, the scales have been transformed to mimic the appearance of assorted candies, incorporating a variety of bright colors such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, pink, and purple. Some scales have a glossy finish akin to sugar-coated candies, and others display swirl patterns, adding to the playful and whimsical aesthetic. The head of the fish retains its rounded form with pronounced eyes and lips, and the pectoral fins remain delicate and slightly translucent. The transformation results in a unique and lively hybrid of a tropical fish with candy-like scales.
