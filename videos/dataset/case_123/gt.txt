The 3D model now features a Doraemon-themed desk organizer, incorporating the character's iconic design elements alongside magical gadgets. The organizer retains Doraemon's round, blue body shape with a white face and stomach. It showcases large, expressive eyes and a small, red nose, with whiskers extending from each side of the face. The character's trademark red collar with a yellow bell is present, adding to the familiar appearance. The short arms and legs are integrated into the organizer's structure, along with white hands and feet. A small red ball resembling a tail is incorporated as a playful design element. Magical gadgets are creatively included in the design, enhancing the functionality and theme of the desk organizer. The overall design is cute, friendly, and distinctly reminiscent of Doraemon. The image file, Doraemon.png, represents the cartoon character's features, which serve as the basis for the desk organizer's design.
