The new design features a Luna-themed night light, incorporating elements from the original Luna.png image. The night light showcases a cute, stylized character with a large, round body and a small head, maintaining the character's playful and adorable nature. The character's blue hair with bangs and prominent cat ears are highlighted, along with the blue outfit featuring a sailor-style collar and an orange tie. The chibi-like appearance is emphasized by the large, bright pink eyes. The body resembles a shiny, coiled tail, adorned with a yellow button or emblem, which adds a whimsical touch to the night light. The 'night-themed design' blends seamlessly, creating a cozy and enchanting atmosphere. The Luna.png image provides a colorful and cartoonish illustration, which is transformed into a charming and unique night light.
