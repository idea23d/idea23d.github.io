The 3D model now features a camera with Pikachu-themed elements, creating a whimsical fusion of technology and character design. The main body of the camera retains its rectangular shape with rounded edges, typical of a DSLR or mirrorless camera, complete with buttons, dials, and a display screen. However, the design incorporates Pikachu's distinct features: the camera is predominantly yellow, matching Pikachu's iconic color, with red circular accents reminiscent of its cheeks. The lens has been redesigned to mimic Pikachu's playful eyes, adding character to the device. The camera's mounting system includes Pikachu's lightning bolt-shaped tail as a decorative element. Pikachu's long ears, with black tips, are cleverly integrated into the camera's design, perhaps as part of the flash or additional accessories. This transformation results in a charming and unique Pikachu-themed camera that blends functionality with a beloved character's aesthetic.

The OBJ files, camera.obj and Pikachu.obj, represent these respective models. The camera model displays a detailed and realistic setup for professional photography, while the Pikachu model captures a playful, cartoon-like character with bold colors and expressive features.
