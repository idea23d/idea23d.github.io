The 3D model now depicts a chair with the texture of wood applied to its surface, transforming it into a wooden chair. The chair retains its elegant and classic design, featuring a sturdy wooden frame, a gently curved backrest, slightly padded seat, integrated armrests, and straight, tapering legs. The wood texture from the image of vertical planks is seamlessly integrated, adding a rich brown color with natural grain patterns to the chair's surface. This gives the chair a realistic and organic appearance, with subtle variations in tone that enhance its depth and character. The combination results in a sophisticated piece of furniture that maintains its original design while showcasing the aesthetic appeal of natural wood.
The OBJ file, chair.obj, represents the structural model of the chair, while the image wood_texture.png provides the detailed wooden texture applied to the chair, featuring a smooth, continuous surface with distinct grain patterns.
