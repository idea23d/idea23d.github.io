The 3D model now features a lamp inspired by a unicorn, combining elements from both the unicorn image and the lamp model. The lamp retains its classic structure with a conical beige lampshade, a glossy vase-like body, and a stable metallic base. However, it has been creatively infused with unicorn-themed elements. The body of the lamp is now adorned with a light blue color, reminiscent of the unicorn's body, and the glossy finish mimics the unicorn's whimsical charm. The lamp's neck is embellished with a spiraled, golden-brown pattern inspired by the unicorn's horn, adding a touch of fantasy. The base and fittings maintain their polished metallic appearance but may feature subtle accents that echo the unicorn's vibrant pink mane. Overall, the lamp design captures the playful and magical essence of the unicorn while maintaining the functional elegance of a classic table lamp.
