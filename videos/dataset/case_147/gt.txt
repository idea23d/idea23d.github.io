The 3D model now features a Doraemon-themed umbrella, combining elements of both the umbrella and the Doraemon character. The umbrella retains its original functional design with a smooth, curved canopy and a slender shaft with a classic hook handle. However, the canopy is now adorned with Doraemon-themed elements, such as the character's iconic blue color and features. The sections of the canopy might showcase Doraemonâ€™s face, complete with a white face, large circular eyes, a red nose, and whisker-like lines, integrating the character's friendly expression into the umbrella's design. The addition of Doraemon's red collar and yellow bell motif around the center of the canopy adds to the theme, making it a playful and distinctive accessory.

The OBJ files, umbrella.obj and Doraemon.obj, represent these respective models. The umbrella model captures the essential features of a functional umbrella with a structured canopy and sturdy frame, while the Doraemon model showcases the character's round, blue form with expressive facial features and simple yet charming design.
