The 3D model now presents a chair with a lion-themed design, integrating the majestic features of a lion's head into the chair structure. The backrest of the chair is adorned with the illustration of a lion's head, seamlessly blending the lion's rich, voluminous mane into the wooden texture. The mane, depicted in flowing shades of orange and brown, adds texture and a sense of regal elegance to the chair. The lion's face, with its warm golden color and expressive eyes, is prominently displayed on the backrest, giving the chair a lifelike and powerful presence. The chair retains its original wooden construction, maintaining its sturdy, classic design with a flat seat, horizontal armrests, and outward-angled legs. The combination results in a unique and artistic piece of furniture that captures the essence of both the lion's majestic imagery and the chair's functional design. The image file lion.png provides the detailed illustration of the lion's head, while the OBJ file chair.obj represents the classic wooden chair model.
