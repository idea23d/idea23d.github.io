The resulting image features a character that is a hybrid of Ultraman and Sailor Mercury, combining elements from both designs into a unique outfit. The character retains Ultraman's sleek, metallic body, characterized by its silver and red color scheme and futuristic, aerodynamic design. The helmet-like head, with its pointed structures and glowing yellow eyes, remains intact, preserving Ultraman's classic tokusatsu appearance. The chest displays the circular emblem with a blue center, suggesting a source of power.

Incorporating elements from Sailor Mercury, the character now wears a modified version of the sailor-style uniform. The outfit includes a white top with a blue collar, complemented by a matching blue bow at the chest, adorned with a red gem. The lower half features a blue pleated skirt, and the character wears blue knee-high boots with heels. Additionally, long white gloves with blue bands encircle the upper arms, blending seamlessly with the metallic features of Ultraman.

The overall appearance is a creative fusion, resulting in a distinctive and imaginative superhero character that merges the iconic features of both Ultraman and Sailor Mercury's attire.
