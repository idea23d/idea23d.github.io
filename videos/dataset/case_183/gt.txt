The 3D model now features a boat with the body of a blue whale, creating a whale-shaped vessel. The boat retains its smooth, rounded shape and asymmetrical design, but the exterior now resembles the sleek form of a blue whale. The whale's elongated body, dark blue upper side, and lighter underbelly have been integrated into the boat's structure, providing a unique and artistic appearance. The whale's fins and fluke are subtly suggested in the design, enhancing the marine theme. The combination results in a creative and visually striking hybrid of a boat with whale-like features. 

The original image, whale.png, depicts a blue whale swimming, showcasing its streamlined body and oceanic colors. The OBJ file, boat.obj, represents a minimalist bowl with an organic, asymmetric shape. This transformation blends the characteristics of both the whale and the boat, resulting in a novel and imaginative 3D model.
