The 3D model now features an umbrella with butterfly wings, integrating the vibrant colors and intricate patterns of the butterfly's wings into the design. The umbrella’s canopy is adorned with these butterfly wings, displaying a striking combination of yellow, orange, red, and black hues. The upper wing sections are predominantly yellow with black patterns and white spots, while the lower sections transition into orange, blue, and black, featuring black spots and tail-like extensions. This transformation adds a vivid and eye-catching aesthetic to the traditional umbrella shape, while maintaining its classic structure. The umbrella retains its large, rounded canopy and J-shaped handle, with the butterfly wings seamlessly integrated into the panels, creating a unique blend of practicality and artistic design.
