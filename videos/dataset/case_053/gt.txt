The 3D model now features a lamp with a shade designed to resemble feathers, combining modernity with a touch of elegance. The lamp maintains its contemporary structure with an oval-shaped base and sleek cylindrical stem, incorporating a ribbed texture for added detail. The original lamp shade's simple, tapered cylindrical form is transformed to appear as if it is made of numerous soft, white feathers, inspired by the image. This adds a luxurious and fluffy texture that creates a cozy and sophisticated ambiance when illuminated. The neutral tones of the lamp, with its mix of metal and possible fabric or plastic, remain consistent, providing a stylish contrast to the feather-like texture of the shade. The transformation results in a visually striking and elegant lamp, perfect for a modern minimalist interior.
