The new image features a hybrid character combining elements of Dorami and Frieza. This Dorami-Frieza hybrid retains Dorami's cute, rounded body and spherical head, but now incorporates Frieza’s distinct features. The character has Dorami's small, red, round nose and black oval eyes, maintaining a friendly and expressive appearance. However, the eyes also take on Frieza's piercing green color, adding intensity. The ears remain small and round, while the mouth now has a slightly open expression, hinting at Frieza's aggression.

The character is adorned with Frieza's futuristic, armor-like outfit, predominantly white with golden accents, particularly on the shoulders, blending seamlessly with Dorami's minimalist design. The combination of Dorami’s soft, smooth texture and Frieza’s well-defined musculature gives the character a unique, charming yet powerful appearance. The hybrid character stands with Dorami’s small, stubby arms and legs, and a tiny tail, maintaining a balance between the two original designs.

The images, Dorami.png and Frieza.png, represent these respective characters. Dorami is depicted as a cute, cartoon-like figure with a minimalist design, while Frieza is shown in a highly detailed, anime-style rendering with vibrant colors and precise shading.
