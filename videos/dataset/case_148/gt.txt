The 3D model now presents a Snorlax-themed hairbrush, creatively combining the features of both models. The hairbrush retains its original elongated handle and broad, flat head but is now adorned with Snorlax-themed details. The handle, still ergonomic and light brown, complements the transformation by incorporating Snorlax's blue and creamy beige color scheme.

The brush head features Snorlax's smiling face, with small eyes and a round nose, seamlessly integrated into the design. The bristles remain numerous and evenly spaced, maintaining their functionality while adding a playful touch with the Snorlax motif. The back of the brush head, smooth and matching the handle, now includes elements reminiscent of Snorlax's rounded, chubby form, enhancing its whimsical appeal.

The OBJ files, hairbrush.obj and Snorlax.obj, represent these respective models. The hairbrush model showcases a practical design with ergonomic features, while the Snorlax model captures a charming, cartoonish creature with a friendly appearance. The fusion results in a unique, Snorlax-inspired grooming accessory.
