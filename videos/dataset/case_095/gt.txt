The resulting image features a Goku-Bulbasaur hybrid character, combining elements of both the original designs. This hybrid character retains Goku's spiky black hair and expressive eyes, while incorporating Bulbasaur's light green, spotted skin and plant bulb on the back. The hybrid wears Goku's iconic orange gi with a blue undershirt, wristbands, and belt, maintaining the martial artist theme. The stance is confident and dynamic, much like Goku's, but the character stands on four short legs with three white claws, akin to Bulbasaur. The eyes are large and bright red, blending Bulbasaur's friendly expression with Goku's determined look. This fusion creates a unique and imaginative character that merges the distinctive features of both Goku and Bulbasaur.

The images Goku.png and Bulbasaur.png represent the original characters. Goku.png depicts a vibrant martial artist with dynamic colors, while Bulbasaur.png showcases a friendly, dinosaur-like creature with a plant bulb.
