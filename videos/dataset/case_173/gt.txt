The 3D model now features a table fan with a Jigglypuff-themed pink color. The fan retains its classic design, with a sturdy base and a vertical stand connecting to the circular fan head. The fan head, which contains multiple aerodynamically shaped blades, is encased in a protective grill with a mesh-like appearance. The motor housing at the back remains rounded, designed for optimal air intake. The original muted, neutral color scheme has been replaced with Jigglypuff's iconic pink color, giving the fan a playful and whimsical appearance. The transformation results in a unique fan that combines the functional aspects of a table fan with the vibrant and cheerful aesthetic of Jigglypuff. The OBJ file, fan.obj, represents this model, showcasing the structural details of the fan, now enhanced with the bright pink coloration inspired by Jigglypuff.
