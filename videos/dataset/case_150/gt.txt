The 3D model now features a Doraemon-themed watch, combining elements from both the watch and Doraemon models. The watch retains its classic design with a round face and leather strap, but now incorporates Doraemon-themed details. The watch face may include Doraemon's iconic features, such as his round, blue head and friendly eyes, creating a playful and recognizable design. The casing remains sleek and metallic, while the strap continues to be crafted from leather, providing a blend of elegance and character. 

The OBJ files, watch.obj and Doraemon.obj, represent these respective models. The watch model displays a traditional timepiece with a simple, elegant style, while the Doraemon model captures the playful essence of the beloved cartoon character with its blue, round shape and minimalistic features. This combination results in a unique and whimsical accessory that appeals to fans of the character.
