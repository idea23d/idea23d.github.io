The 3D model now features a fusion of Moltres and the Sailor Moon staff, creating a unique and imaginative design. The dragon retains its cartoonish style with a bright red body and creamy yellow underbelly, complemented by vivid blue eyes and flame-like orange spikes on its head. The large, bat-like wings with orange and red highlights remain intact, as does the blazing flame at the end of its tail. However, the transformation incorporates elements from the Sailor Moon staff: a large, golden crescent moon now adorns the dragon's head, resembling a crown, while a decorative pink bow is wrapped around its neck, with a blue gem at the center adding an elegant touch. The staff's golden, ornate design is subtly integrated along the dragon's body, enhancing its magical and regal appearance. The combination results in a fantastical creature that blends the fiery essence of Moltres with the mystical elegance of the Sailor Moon staff. The images, Moltres.png and Sailor_Moon_staff.png, represent these respective elements. The Moltres image depicts a vibrant and dynamic dragon character, while the Sailor Moon staff image showcases a detailed magical staff with elegant features.
