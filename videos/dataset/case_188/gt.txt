The 3D model now features a lamp with an owl's head, creating a unique blend of functionality and whimsical design. The lamp retains its modern and minimalist aesthetic with a rounded, bulbous base and a cylindrical lampshade. The base is a deep teal or blue, contrasting with the soft white or cream lampshade. Attached to the top of the lampshade is the owl's head from the owl.png image, characterized by its large, expressive eyes with orange and black irises. The owl's head adds a playful element, with its round and plump shape, small black beak, and fluffy ear tufts. This transformation gives the lamp an owl-like vision, making it a charming and imaginative addition to any interior space. The OBJ file, lamp.obj, represents the structural base of the lamp, while the owl's head from the owl.png image brings a whimsical character to the piece.
