The 3D model now features a Corgi styled after Van Gogh's Sunflowers. The Corgi retains its characteristic features such as its short legs, long body, and expressive face. However, the surface of the model has been artistically transformed to reflect the vibrant colors and bold brush strokes typical of Van Gogh's Sunflowers. The fur texture of the Corgi is reimagined with swirling patterns and bright yellows, greens, and browns, echoing the dynamic and textured appearance of the famous painting. The entire model maintains the Corgi's playful and charming posture, but with an added layer of artistic depth and visual interest. The transformation results in a unique and creative fusion of a beloved dog breed with a classic art style.
The OBJ file represents this artistic Corgi model. The original Corgi model showcases a realistic depiction of the dog, while the Van Gogh-inspired textures bring a new dimension of color and style to the piece.
