The 3D model now features a Doraemon robot charger, integrating a robotic design while retaining the character's playful essence. The model maintains Doraemon's distinctive spherical head with large white eyes, a small red nose, and a wide smile, complete with the three whisker-like lines on each cheek. The blue body is shiny and round, preserving the character's iconic look. The addition of robotic elements is evident in the mechanical, segmented limbs with blue and gray metallic hues, claw-like hands, and sturdy legs with rounded feet. The robot charger design includes two antennae on top of its head and yellow headphones with red accents, highlighting its futuristic style. The small, round red tail remains at the back. The transformation results in a unique blend of Doraemon's playful appearance and a functional robotic design, suitable for a charger.
