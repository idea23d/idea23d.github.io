The 3D model now features a Charmander-themed flashlight, combining elements from both original models. The main body retains the cylindrical shape and robust appearance of a flashlight, but it is now styled with Charmander's distinctive features. The flashlight's outer surface is primarily orange, mimicking Charmander's body color, with a lighter cream-colored underside. The head of the flashlight is shaped like Charmander's rounded head, complete with large, expressive eyes and a small mouth. The top of the flashlight includes a flame design, inspired by Charmander's fiery tail, adding a unique decorative element. The original flashlight's functional elements, such as the ribbed grip and lever, are seamlessly integrated into the Charmander-themed design for practical use. The transformation results in a creative and playful interpretation, merging Charmander's iconic characteristics with the utility of a flashlight. The OBJ files, flashlight.obj and Charmander.obj, represent these respective models. The flashlight model features a cylindrical, tactical design with metallic textures, while the Charmander model showcases a small, lizard-like creature with vibrant colors and a dynamic flame.
