The 3D model now features a teacup with a handle shaped like a snake, replacing the original small, rounded handle. The teacup retains its cylindrical shape with a slightly flared rim, and it remains part of a simple cup-and-saucer set. The saucer continues to be circular with a slightly raised edge and a smooth, concave shape, providing stability. The new snake handle is designed to be ergonomic, coiling elegantly around the side of the cup. It features intricate scale details and a polished metallic surface, mimicking the look of a real snake with a lifelike texture. The head of the snake is slightly raised, adding a dynamic element to the design. The overall appearance of the teacup and saucer remains minimalist, with a light color scheme, but the addition of the snake handle introduces a unique and artistic flair.

The OBJ file, teacup.obj, represents the cup-and-saucer set with its simple, functional design. The image file, snake_handle.png, showcases a detailed metallic sculpture of a snake, emphasizing its fluid form and polished texture.
