The 3D model now depicts a hippopotamus with a crystal-like skin texture. The hippo maintains its realistic anatomical structure, characterized by a large, rounded body, a wide mouth, small eyes and ears positioned on the top of the head, short stout legs, and a stubby tail. However, the traditional leathery skin has been replaced with a texture resembling a crystalline surface. This crystal skin features a grid-like pattern with transparent, glass-like qualities, reflecting and refracting light to display pastel hues of pinks, blues, and purples. This transformation gives the hippopotamus a unique and visually striking appearance, blending realism with an abstract texture. The OBJ file, hippo.obj, represents the base model of the hippopotamus, while the image crystal_skin.png provides the inspiration for the crystal-like texture applied to the hippo's skin.
