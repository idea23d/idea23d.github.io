The 3D model now features a lamp inspired by the majestic phoenix, seamlessly integrating the mythical bird's vibrant elements into the lamp's design. The lampshade is reimagined to resemble the phoenix's wings, with layers of feathers transitioning from deep orange at the base to bright yellow at the tips, giving the appearance of flames. The body of the lamp incorporates the phoenix's fiery plumage, with intricate details that mimic the bird's dynamic and powerful presence. The lamp's base remains sturdy and rounded, but its dark, polished finish complements the phoenix's intense, glowing eyes and sharp, red beak. This transformation results in a unique and enchanting hybrid of a traditional lamp and the mythical phoenix, creating a striking piece that captures the essence of fire and mystique.
