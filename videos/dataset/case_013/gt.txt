The 3D model now features a cat with a noticeably enlarged belly, as if it has swallowed a whole mango, while maintaining its seated posture. The cat's body retains its realistic form, with a smooth and rounded appearance, visible muscle contours, and a thick tail wrapped around its side. The head remains slightly tilted upwards, with well-defined ears and a relaxed expression, although the mouth might appear slightly more open to suggest the act of swallowing. The texture and coloration of the cat are preserved, showcasing a striped pattern typical of a tabby, with shades of brown and orange. The transformation humorously integrates the concept of the cat having a mango-sized bulge in its abdomen.
The OBJ file, cat.obj, represents this detailed cat sculpture, capturing its anatomical features and lifelike textures. The image a_m_2.png depicts a ripe mango with a vibrant yellow and red gradient, smooth surface, and glossy texture, which has inspired the playful transformation of the cat model.
