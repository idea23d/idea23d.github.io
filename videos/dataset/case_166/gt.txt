The 3D model now features Charizard-themed cutlery, combining the knife and fork with the iconic flame design of Charizard. The original fork retains its classic design with four tines and an ergonomic handle, while the knife maintains its smooth, slightly curved blade and matching handle. The transformation incorporates Charizard's flame motif, adding a fiery aesthetic to the handles, which is characterized by vibrant orange and red hues, mimicking the distinctive flame of Charizard. The polished finish of the metal remains, enhancing the reflective surface with the new fiery design. The overall effect is a unique and visually striking set of dining utensils that embody the mythical essence of Charizardâ€™s flame.
