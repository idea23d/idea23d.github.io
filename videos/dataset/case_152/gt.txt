The 3D model now features a computer with a Squirtle theme, seamlessly integrating elements from both original models. The desktop computer maintains its classic setup with a monitor, tower, keyboard, and mouse, but is now infused with characteristics from the Squirtle model. The computer components are predominantly colored in a bright blue, mimicking Squirtle's body. The monitor and tower have stylized features, such as expressive eyes and a small, friendly mouth on the monitor's bezel, reminiscent of Squirtle's face. The tower's front panel has designs that resemble Squirtle's shell, with a dark brown and light beige color scheme. The keyboard and mouse are also themed, with the mouse possibly taking on a turtle-like shape, adding to the whimsical design. The entire setup retains the functional layout of a traditional desktop computer, but the playful Squirtle elements transform it into a unique, cartoon-inspired device.
The OBJ files, computer.obj and Squirtle.obj, represent these respective models. The computer model depicts a classic desktop configuration with utilitarian design, while the Squirtle model showcases a cute, cartoon-like turtle with bright colors and expressive features.
