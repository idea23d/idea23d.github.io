The 3D model now features a hedgehog with quills that resemble candy canes, maintaining its original cartoonish and playful appearance. The hedgehog's body is round and compact, with a slightly larger head, short limbs, and a prominent snout with a rounded nose. The eyes remain large and circular, giving it an expressive and friendly look. The spines on the back have been transformed to mimic the appearance of candy canes, incorporating the red and white twisted pattern from the candy_canes.png image. These candy cane-like quills add a festive and whimsical touch to the model. The front of the body and the underbelly remain smooth and lighter in color, consistent with the original design. The limbs suggest a relaxed sitting posture, and the feet are simple and rounded. This transformation results in a charming and unique hedgehog model with candy cane-inspired quills. The OBJ file hedgehog.obj represents the hedgehog model with stylized features, while the IMG file candy_canes.png depicts the pattern of red and white twisted candy canes used for the quills.
