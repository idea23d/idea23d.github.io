The 3D model now features a soap block with Totoro-themed design elements. The core shape remains a rectangular block with smooth, rounded edges, maintaining its soap-like appearance. The surface has a gradient color scheme in shades of yellow and beige, with small speckles adding texture. However, the front of the soap now prominently displays Totoro's face and features, including large, round eyes, a small smile, and whiskers. The pattern of upside-down black V-shapes from Totoro's belly is integrated into the design. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of the soap's practical form with the whimsical and friendly characteristics of Totoro. The OBJ files, soap.obj and Totoro.obj, represent these respective models. The soap model shows a simple yet detailed rectangular shape with natural coloring, while the Totoro model showcases a chubby creature with a distinctive round body and friendly features.
