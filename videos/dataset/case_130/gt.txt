The holder incorporates elements from the image, such as the traditional red kimono pattern and the sword's golden hilt, translating them into decorative motifs. The holder's structure mimics the flowing lines of the character's attire, with accents resembling the small red horns and devil-like tail, adding a thematic touch. The overall appearance is both functional and aesthetically aligned with the anime style.
