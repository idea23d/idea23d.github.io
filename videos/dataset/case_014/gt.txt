The 3D model now features a teapot adorned with Picasso's classic painting on its front surface. The original shape and structure of the teapot remain intact, with its rounded, bulbous body and a slightly tapered top. The prominent curved spout and the large, arc-shaped handle are preserved, maintaining the classic design elements. The smooth ceramic finish of the teapot, originally showcasing a neutral color, now serves as a canvas for the vivid and abstract patterns typical of Picasso's artwork. The contrast between the artistic painting and the minimalist teapot design creates a striking visual effect. The lid remains circular with a small knob, complementing the overall aesthetic. The OBJ file, casen.obj, represents this teapot model, initially characterized by its simple, elegant form and functional design, now enhanced with a unique artistic touch.
