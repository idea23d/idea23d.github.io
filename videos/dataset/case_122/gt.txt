The 3D model now features a Snorlax bean bag design, merging the original Snorlax-like character with a 'comfortable design' aesthetic. The creature retains its chubby, rounded body, blue hue, and cream-colored belly, which are typical of Snorlax's appearance. Its small, closed eyes and wide smiling mouth contribute to a joyful and relaxed expression, fitting for a bean bag. The short limbs and pointed claws on its feet are maintained, adding to its playful look. The transformation emphasizes comfort with the soft, plush appearance of a bean bag, making it both a practical and whimsical piece of furniture.
