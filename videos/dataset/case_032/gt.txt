The edited 3D model now depicts a knight, originally from the image knight.png, wielding the sword from the sword.obj model. The knight maintains the original pose, dressed in a full suit of polished medieval armor that reflects light and showcases intricate details. The armor includes a helmet with a narrow visor, a breastplate with an intricate crest, and a red cape draped behind. The sword originally held by the knight has been replaced with the new sword from sword.obj. This sword features a double-edged blade with a slightly worn metallic texture, a straight crossguard, and a cylindrical grip, possibly wrapped for a secure hold. The pommel adds balance to the weapon, enhancing its historical authenticity. The combination results in a cohesive and striking image of a medieval knight brandishing a classic sword. The image file knight.png and the OBJ file sword.obj represent these respective elements. The knight image captures the detailed armor and red cloth, while the sword model showcases a functional and historically inspired weapon.
