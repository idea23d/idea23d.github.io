The 3D model now features a hybrid creation of R2D2 and Goku, merging elements from both iconic figures. The body retains the classic cylindrical shape of R2D2, complete with the dome-shaped head, white body, and blue and silver detailing, along with the signature panels, buttons, and lights. However, the design now incorporates Goku's distinct features, such as the spiky black hair adorning the top of the dome and elements of Goku's attire. The robot's exterior is accented with Goku's orange martial arts gi, including the black emblem on the chest, and blue highlights that mirror Goku's undershirt and belt. The legs of the robot are now styled with Goku's blue boots featuring orange accents, maintaining the original configuration of two main legs and a third smaller leg. This unique combination results in a seamless blend of mechanical and martial artistry, creating an R2D2-Goku robot that embodies the essence of both characters. The images, R2D2.png and Goku.png, depict the respective models and styles: R2D2 as a sleek, iconic sci-fi robot, and Goku as a chibi-style martial artist with expressive features and vibrant attire.
