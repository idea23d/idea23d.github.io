The 3D model now features a table lamp inspired by the vibrant wings of a butterfly. The lamp retains its vintage-style design with a metallic stem and a wide, sturdy base, but the lampshade has been transformed to mimic the butterfly's colorful wings. The upper part of the lampshade showcases a striking blend of blue and purple hues, seamlessly transitioning into a spectrum of warm colors like bright orange and yellow, reminiscent of the butterfly's wings. The intricate patterns and colors create a visually stunning and harmonious effect, while the overall elegance of the lamp's structure remains intact. The combination results in a unique and artistic piece that captures the beauty of a butterfly's wings in the form of a functional lamp.
