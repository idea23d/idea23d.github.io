The 3D model now features a castle with walls designed to look like they are constructed from books, creating a unique blend of medieval architecture and literary elements. The original structure of the castle, with its multiple towers and crenellated walls, remains intact. The central large tower and surrounding smaller towers with conical roofs are preserved, maintaining the classic castle silhouette. However, the walls have been transformed to mimic the appearance of stacked books, inspired by the image of a bookshelf. The books vary in size, thickness, and color, echoing the diversity seen in the image, with the colors ranging from earthy tones to deeper reds and blues. This creative alteration results in a whimsical and imaginative structure that combines the grandeur of a medieval castle with the charm of a library.

The OBJ file, castle.obj, represents the original castle model with its medieval architectural elements, while the image books.png provides the visual reference for the book-like texture and coloration applied to the castle's walls.
