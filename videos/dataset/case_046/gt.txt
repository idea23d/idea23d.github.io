The 3D model now features a gazebo that resembles it's made from giant seashells, incorporating the organic and flowing patterns from the seashell image. The circular base and conical roof of the gazebo remain intact, but the structure's surface is transformed with the intricate spiral and ribbon-like patterns inspired by the seashell. The roof retains its pointed shape, yet now appears to be crafted from a shell-like material, adding a whimsical and oceanic feel. The cylindrical columns supporting the roof mimic the smooth, silky texture of the seashell, and their arrangement creates open archways that echo the natural curves found in the seashell image. The overall color palette of the gazebo adopts soft shades of purple, blue, and gray, reflecting the calming and fluid nature of the seashell design. This transformation results in a unique and artistic gazebo, blending classical architectural elements with the natural beauty of seashells.

The OBJ file, gazebo.obj, originally depicted a small, ornate pavilion with a classical design, while the image, seashell.png, presented a detailed abstract spiral pattern with a soothing color palette and smooth texture.
