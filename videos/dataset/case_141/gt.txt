The 3D model now features a backpack with an integrated water bottle holder, seamlessly combining the two original models. The backpack maintains its sleek, modern design with a predominantly black color, likely made from durable materials like nylon or polyester, giving it a professional and robust appearance. The rectangular, boxy structure with rounded edges remains intact, providing a smooth look. The front of the backpack still showcases multiple compartments and zippers for ample storage, while the back retains its padded shoulder straps and back panel for comfort. The transformation incorporates the water bottle into one of the side compartments, designed specifically to hold the cylindrical bottle securely. The bottle's translucent plastic material and light blue color are visible, adding a functional and stylish element to the backpack. The bottle itself retains its ergonomic design with a screw-on cap and subtle groove for grip. The integration results in a practical and versatile backpack suitable for everyday use, enhanced by the convenient addition of a water bottle holder. The OBJ files, backpack.obj and water_bottle.obj, represent these respective models. The backpack model showcases a detailed and ergonomic design with multiple features, while the water bottle model highlights a functional and user-friendly structure.
