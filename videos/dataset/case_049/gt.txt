The 3D model now features a bird with wings that resemble maple leaves, maintaining the original perched position on a branch. The bird's body remains rounded with a small head, beak, and fan-shaped tail, all detailed with realistic feather textures. However, the wings have been transformed to mimic the appearance of maple leaves, incorporating the vibrant colors and intricate vein patterns seen in the image. These maple leaf wings display shades of deep red, bright orange, and golden yellow, capturing the essence of autumn. The natural textures of the leaves complement the bird's realistic features, resulting in a unique and creative hybrid design.

The OBJ file, bird.obj, represents the initial bird model, showcasing a lifelike anatomical structure with detailed feather texturing and a natural perching posture. The image file, maple_leaves.png, provides the colorful and detailed maple leaf patterns used to transform the bird's wings, adding a seasonal and artistic touch to the model.
