The resulting image features a hybrid creature combining elements of Bulbasaur and Snorlax. The new creature retains Bulbasaur's light green body with darker green spots, as well as the large plant bulb on its back. However, it adopts Snorlax's plump and round shape, along with its predominantly blue coloration and cream-colored belly. The hybrid has a mix of Bulbasaur's large, expressive red eyes and Snorlax's small, curved eyes, giving it a unique and friendly expression. It stands on four legs like Bulbasaur but with a more robust stance reminiscent of Snorlax, and each limb ends in three claws. The overall appearance is a charming blend of both creatures, maintaining a cartoonish and friendly style.

The input images, Bulbasaur.png and Snorlax.png, depict these respective creatures. Bulbasaur is shown as a small, dinosaur-like creature with plant-like features, while Snorlax is a large, plump creature with a cheerful demeanor.
