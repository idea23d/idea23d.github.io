The 3D model now features a digital camera with Doraemon's bamboo copter attached to it. The camera retains its original structure, complete with a prominent lens, compact body, and detailed controls for photography. The front of the camera showcases its high-end lens with a red ring, while the back displays an LCD screen for reviewing images. The left and right sides maintain their respective controls and ports, and the top includes the shutter button and mode dial. The addition of Doraemon's bamboo copter gives the camera a whimsical and imaginative touch. The bamboo copter, known for its small, propeller-like design, is attached to the top of the camera, suggesting the camera could be flown or hover in place. The combination creates a unique and playful hybrid that blends the practicality of a professional camera with the fantastical element of Doraemon's gadget.
