The 3D model now features a countryside retreat inspired by the rustic charm of a barn, as depicted in the provided image. The retreat maintains the essence of a traditional wooden house with a two-story structure and a prominent gabled roof. The roof's texture suggests an aged, weathered appearance, echoing the barn's classic style. The front view features a covered porch with supporting columns, reminiscent of the barn's sturdy construction, along with suggested windows and a door typical of residential architecture. The sides of the retreat extend the wooden paneling, with a slight overhang on the left side, possibly indicating additional entrances or windows, adding to the rustic aesthetic. The back of the house maintains simplicity, while the top view emphasizes the detailed roof design. The bottom view ensures the model's foundation is suitable for placement on a flat surface, akin to a rural setting.
