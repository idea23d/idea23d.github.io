The 3D model now features a wooden armchair enhanced with butterfly wings attached to the backrest. The chair retains its classic, minimalist design, with a natural wood finish that highlights the grain and texture. The sturdy frame, broad backrest, flat seat, and wide armrests remain intact, providing comfort and stability with its slightly reclined backrest and angled legs. The addition of the butterfly wings introduces a vibrant and whimsical element to the chair. The wings are vividly colored with a harmonious blend of yellow, orange, and black patterns. The upper wings have scalloped edges and dark spots near the tips, while the lower wings feature an orange gradient transitioning to a darker shade with blue accents. This transformation creates a unique and artistic chair that combines functionality with the intricate beauty of a butterfly.
