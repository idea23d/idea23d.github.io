The 3D model now features a cylindrical battery with a dragon-scale texture applied to its surface. The battery maintains its original cylindrical shape with a consistent diameter from top to bottom, along with the metallic or reflective finish. The smooth surface is now covered in a detailed pattern resembling dragon scales, adding a unique, textured appearance to the model. The top retains its small, raised circular detail, resembling a cap, while the bottom remains flat with a slight central indentation. This transformation results in a visually striking battery that combines the sleek form of the original model with the intricate texture of dragon scales.

The OBJ file, battery.obj, represents the original cylindrical model, characterized by its smooth metallic surface and minimal detailing. The addition of the dragon scale texture introduces a new level of complexity and aesthetic appeal to the otherwise simple design.
