The 3D model now depicts a luxurious bathtub inspired by the smoothness and appearance of river stones. The original bowl shape of the bathtub.obj has been transformed to resemble the natural, rounded forms of the stones in river_stones.png. The bathtub maintains a smooth, matte finish, but now features a more organic shape with gentle curves and a slightly uneven surface, mimicking the natural texture and contours of river pebbles. The handle has been redesigned to blend seamlessly with the stone-like appearance, possibly resembling a natural outgrowth or extension of the bathtub's form. The color palette is now reflective of the pebbles' earthy tones, incorporating shades of gray, beige, and light brown to enhance the natural, luxurious feel. The resulting design is a harmonious blend of functionality and aesthetic elegance, evoking the serene beauty of a riverbed. The OBJ file, bathtub.obj, represents this newly crafted model, while the image river_stones.png serves as the visual inspiration for the texture and color of the bathtub.
