The 3D model now features a lamp shaped like a mushroom with a glowing cap. The lamp retains its modern, minimalist design, characterized by a sleek dome-shaped shade that smoothly directs light downward. The slender, curved stem connects the shade to the circular, flat base, maintaining the lamp's cohesive and elegant aesthetic. The color scheme remains neutral, with a stylish contrast between the darker shade and the lighter stem and base. The mushroom cap, as shown in the image, enhances the lamp's design with its numerous circular cutouts, allowing light to create intricate, dotted patterns on the surroundings. The overall effect is a cozy and elegant atmosphere, suitable for modern interiors.
