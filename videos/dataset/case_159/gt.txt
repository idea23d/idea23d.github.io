The 3D model now features a Doraemon-themed decorative item incorporating a blue and white color scheme. The character retains its original stylized, cartoon-like design, with a round, blue body and a large, spherical head. The face is characterized by a small red nose, wide white eyes, and whisker-like lines. The torso remains compact with a white circular belly and a small yellow bell at the neck. The arms are short and cylindrical, while the legs are stubby and rounded with white feet. A small red circular detail is present on the back, adding to the whimsical toy-like appearance. This transformation results in a playful decorative item inspired by the Doraemon character.
The OBJ file, Doraemon.obj, represents this model, showcasing the character's bright colors, exaggerated features, and charming design.
