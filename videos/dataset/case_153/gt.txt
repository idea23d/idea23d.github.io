The 3D model now features an Eevee-themed wallet, combining the sleek design of a wallet with the charming elements of an Eevee character. The wallet maintains its original form with multiple compartments and a smooth, leather-like surface. However, it now incorporates Eevee's distinct features, such as the soft, warm brown color with a cream-colored mane motif around the edges. The front of the wallet includes stylized representations of Eevee's large, expressive eyes and pointed ears, adding a playful and whimsical touch. The back remains sleek and unadorned, preserving its sophisticated look, while subtle Eevee-themed details are integrated into the design. The wallet retains its compact and functional design, making it both a practical accessory and a delightful nod to the beloved character.
The OBJ files, wallet.obj and Eevee.obj, represent these respective models. The wallet model displays a functional, streamlined profile typical of leather wallets, while the Eevee model is a stylized, cartoonish representation of a fox-like creature with expressive features and a fluffy tail.
