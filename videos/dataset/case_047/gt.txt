The 3D model now features a modern chair with a seat inspired by the texture of a kiwi fruit. The chair retains its original rounded, egg-like shape and smooth, curved backrest, which provides a cocoon-like appearance and ergonomic support. The outer shell remains sleek and polished, possibly made of wood or plastic in a neutral, earthy tone. The seat, however, has been transformed, incorporating the vibrant green texture of kiwi fruit seen in the image. This texture displays the juicy, fibrous pattern of kiwi slices, with a lighter center and small black seeds, adding a unique and refreshing visual element to the chair. The legs maintain their angled position, ensuring stability and cohesion with the overall design. The transformation results in a stylish, contemporary chair that serves as a statement piece with a playful and natural twist on the seat. The OBJ file, chair.obj, represents the chair model, showcasing its modern design elements, while the image file, kiwi_texture.png, provides the detailed kiwi-inspired texture used for the seat.
