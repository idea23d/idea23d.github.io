The 3D model now presents a wallet with an integrated key holder, combining the sleek design of the wallet with the practical functionality of a key. The wallet retains its classic rectangular, bifold design, featuring a leather-like material with a smooth finish and several card slots on the front. The key has been seamlessly incorporated into the design, with its hexagonal bow protruding slightly from the wallet, ensuring easy access and ergonomic grip. The key's metallic blade remains flat with traditional grooves and notches, maintaining its purpose as a functional key. The integration results in a stylish and efficient accessory that serves both as a wallet and a key holder, perfect for everyday use. 

The OBJ files, wallet.obj and key.obj, symbolize these individual models. The wallet model showcases a refined, functional design with card slots, while the key model displays a classic, metallic form with a keyring attached.
