The 3D model now features a Pikachu-shaped light bulb, integrating the classic light bulb design with Pikachu's iconic lightning bolt. The bulb retains its traditional pear-shaped form with a rounded glass envelope and metal base. However, the glass portion is modified to resemble Pikachu's silhouette, incorporating the distinct shape of the lightning bolt as an element of the design. The glass has a smooth, slightly frosted texture, giving it a soft sheen, while the metal base remains metallic, typically silver or brass. This creative fusion results in a whimsical model that combines the familiar features of a light bulb with the playful essence of Pikachu's lightning bolt.

The OBJ file, light_bulb.obj, represents the classic incandescent light bulb model, showcasing realistic proportions and materials. Meanwhile, the concept of Pikachu's lightning bolt adds a unique twist to this otherwise traditional design.
