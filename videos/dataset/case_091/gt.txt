The combined image now features a Squirtle-Charmander hybrid, blending distinctive traits from both characters. The hybrid maintains Squirtle's light blue body and cream-colored underbelly, along with its round head and brown shell on the back. However, it adopts Charmander's bipedal stance, orange lizard-like features, and the iconic flame at the tip of its long tail. The creature's eyes are large and expressive, combining the red hue of Squirtle's eyes with the friendly expression typical of both characters. The hybrid also features small limbs akin to Squirtle, but with Charmander's three sharp claws on each hand and foot. This unique combination results in a playful yet fiery appearance, merging the cute and gentle nature of Squirtle with the spirited charm of Charmander.

The images, Squirtle.png and Charmander.png, represent these respective characters. Squirtle's image shows a turtle-like creature with a cartoonish and friendly design, while Charmander's image depicts a bipedal, lizard-like creature with a fiery tail and expressive features.
