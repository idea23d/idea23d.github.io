The 3D model now features a smartphone with an extended battery incorporated into its design. The phone retains its contemporary look with a large, flat touchscreen covering most of the front surface, and no physical buttons visible on the front, suggesting the use of on-screen navigation. The back view still shows the camera module with multiple lenses and a circular fingerprint sensor. However, the phone's battery has been augmented by integrating the cylindrical battery model onto the back. This cylinder, with its smooth, metallic surface and greyish color, extends the device's depth, indicating increased battery capacity. The sides of the phone continue to display volume control and power buttons, maintaining their sleek, slightly curved edges. The bottom features a charging port and speaker grills, while the top edge remains simple. The transformation results in a practical and innovative smartphone design with enhanced battery life. 

The OBJ files, phone.obj and battery.obj, represent these respective models. The phone model showcases a modern smartphone design with a large display and minimal physical buttons, while the battery model depicts a smooth, metallic cylindrical form.
