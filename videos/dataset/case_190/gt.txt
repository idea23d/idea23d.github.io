The 3D model now features a boat with dolphin fins attached, transforming it into a dolphin-shaped boat. The boat retains its original smooth, rounded shape, resembling a shallow bowl with a sleek, modern appearance. The dolphin fins are integrated into the design, one dorsal fin on top and two pectoral fins on the sides, enhancing the overall structure to mimic the streamlined form of a dolphin. The fins exhibit a shiny blue-gray color with a lighter underside, matching the stylized depiction of a dolphin in the image. The addition of these fins gives the boat a dynamic and unique aesthetic, combining the functionality of a vessel with the graceful form of a dolphin. The OBJ file, boat.obj, represents the initial model with its minimalist design, while the dolphin fins are adapted from the visual elements in dolphin.png, characterized by their smooth curves and expressive details.
