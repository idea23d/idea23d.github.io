The 3D model now features a fun playground slide shaped like a kangaroo, incorporating the whimsical and cartoonish elements of the original model. The kangaroo's smooth, rounded body serves as the main structure of the slide, with the back forming the sliding surface. The large, upright ears and expressive face with big eyes and a small nose add a playful touch to the slide's design. The kangaroo's long tail provides stability at the base, while the extended arms frame the entrance of the slide, inviting children to play. The model retains its friendly brown color with a lighter-toned belly, enhancing the approachable and engaging appearance. The transformation results in a lively and imaginative playground feature that captures the spirit of fun and adventure.
