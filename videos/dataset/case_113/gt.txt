The design results in a Pikachu-themed lamp, incorporating elements from the original Pikachu image. The lamp features the character's distinct yellow coloration and iconic lightning bolt-shaped tail. Pikachu's large, pointed ears with black tips and round black eyes are integrated into the lamp's design, alongside the red circular cheeks that add a playful touch. The body maintains its yellow hue with brown stripes, capturing Pikachu's signature look. The lamp's structure embodies a friendly and cheerful expression, reminiscent of the character's animated form. The image file, Pikachu.png, depicts this beloved character with a small, rodent-like appearance, standing upright with its arms in front.
