The 3D model now features a Squirtle-themed fan, creatively integrating the playful essence of Squirtle into the traditional fan design. The fan retains its original structure with a circular fan head, protective wire grill, and a stable base. However, the fan's aesthetics are transformed to reflect Squirtle's characteristics. The fan blades are stylized to resemble Squirtle's limbs, with a playful, cartoon-like appearance. The motor housing and stand are designed to mimic Squirtle's rounded shell and compact body, incorporating the shell's darker color and smooth texture. The base of the fan takes inspiration from Squirtle's features, possibly incorporating its expressive eyes or gentle smile. The transformed fan blends functionality with a whimsical Squirtle theme, creating a unique and eye-catching piece. The OBJ files, fan.obj and Squirtle.obj, represent these respective models. The fan model showcases a functional and sleek design, while the Squirtle model highlights a rounded, friendly creature with a prominent shell and playful features.
