The 3D model now features a Snorlax-themed book, incorporating elements from Snorlax's sleepy design into the original book model. The book retains its rectangular, compact form with smooth, rounded edges and a sleek finish, but now it also includes distinctive Snorlax features. The front cover of the book resembles Snorlax's face, with closed eyes and a serene expression, capturing the essence of Snorlax's sleepiness. The color scheme incorporates Snorlax's characteristic blue and cream colors, adding to the thematic transformation. The overall design maintains the minimalist and modern aesthetic of the original book model while infusing it with the playful and familiar elements of Snorlax.

The OBJ file, book.obj, represents the original model, which is a sleek, rectangular object with a smooth, matte finish and minimalist design. The transformation adds the Snorlax theme, turning it into a unique and whimsical book.
